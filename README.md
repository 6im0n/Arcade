## **ℹ️ About**
The Arcade project undertaken in the Second year at [{Epitech}](https://www.epitech.eu/) is designed to allow students to put into practice fundamental programming concepts of oriented object with C++ and to introduce to the development of a gaming platform using various graphical library. Its good practice to experiment with Modularization concept.

### **📃 Description**

Arcade is a **gaming platform**: 
a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores. To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plate-form at run-time, your graphics libraries and your games must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at run-time.

Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the main program

> [!CAUTION]
> It is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** to refer to a graphics library explicitly in your main program. Only your dynamic libraries can do so. This also applies to your games.


> [!NOTE]
> These dynamic libraries can be seen as plug-ins providing various capabilities to your main program. In **NO CASE** must graphics libraries influence the game logic. Game libraries must not contain any information about screen rendering or low-level events.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You MUST **NOT** differentiate your libraries. Each of your libraries MUST be handled in a generic and uniform manner. Keep genericity!
