## GitMoji Commit Convention

We use the GitMoji convention for our commit messages. Each commit message should start with an emoji, followed by a verb in present tense, and a brief description of what was done. Here are the emojis we use and their meanings:

- ✨ for adding a feature
- ⚡ for improving a feature
- 🐛 for fixing a bug
- ✏️ for adding or updating headers or Makefile
- 🔀 for merging a branch into another
- 🚚 for changing the repository's structure (renaming or moving files)
- 🥅 for error handling
- ♻️ for Refactoring code in a better way
- 🚧 for work in progress
- 🔥 for removing code
- ⚰️ for removing deprecated/unused code
- 🚨 for fixing warnings
- 🎉 for initial commit
- 📝 for adding documentation
- ✅ for adding tests
- 🙈 for adding .gitignore
- 🔧 for adding or updating configuration files
- 🍱 for adding resources
- 🎨 for improving code structure/format
- 👷 for adding or updating files needed for continuous integration (CI)
- 🥚 for adding bonus or easter egg


Here's an example of a valid commit message:

```
✨ Add new feature to improve user experience
```

## Branching and Merging

- Do not push directly to the main branch.
- Create a branch related to the current issue and make a pull request (PR) to merge the branch.
- At least one person must approve the PR before it can be merged.

## Test Politics

- Criterion

## Code Quality

- Always maintain high-quality code.
